Sure! Here's an overview of HTML and CSS theory without code.

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

**Definition:**
HTML is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It describes the content and layout of a webpage by using a variety of elements and tags.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Elements:** HTML is made up of elements which are building blocks of web pages. Each element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
2. **Tags:** Tags are the instructions used to create HTML elements. Tags are usually in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
3. **Attributes:** Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.
4. **Document Structure:** HTML documents have a defined structure that includes the `doctype`, `html`, `head`, and `body` sections. The `head` contains meta-information about the document, and the `body` contains the actual content to be displayed.

**Purpose:**
HTML is used to structure content on the web, such as text, images, links, and multimedia. It forms the backbone of all web pages.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

**Definition:**
CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Selectors:** Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. Examples include class selectors, ID selectors, and element selectors.
2. **Properties and Values:** Properties are the aspects of the elements that you want to change (e.g., color, font-size). Values are the settings you want to apply to those properties.
3. **Cascading:** The term "cascading" refers to the way CSS applies rules in a hierarchical order. If multiple rules apply to an element, the one with the highest specificity or the last one defined will take precedence.
4. **Box Model:** The box model describes how the different parts of an element (content, padding, border, and margin) are structured and interact with each other.
5. **Responsive Design:** CSS enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing the user experience on various platforms.

**Purpose:**
CSS is used to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing for more flexible and efficient design. It enables developers to create visually appealing websites with consistent styles across multiple pages.
